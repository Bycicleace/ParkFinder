# Park Finder

## Description
A site where you can pull up state parks, organized by state. Then, after selecting a park, you can map it out, and keep a favorites list.

This project utilizes two APIs. The first is the National Park Service (NPS) API to get park information. The second is the Google Maps API to plot the parks on a map.

Additionally, this uses the Foundation CSS Framework.

## Usage

    1. Hover over "Select a State"
    2. Find and click on the state you wish.
    3. That states parks will be listed on the left, with the top selected and mapped out on the right.

- To map out a park:
    1. Locate the park you wish to map out
    2. Click anywhere on that park's card.
    3. A red border is displayed on the park's card indicating selection and the map is updated to show the park's location.

    1. Find the desired park.
